# bubblejumper-js : A [JS13kGames](http://js13kgames.com/) entry

Bubble Jumper: A simple game for simple people. Stay alive and earn points by jumping from bubble to bubble. Beware, the game will flip and test your jumping skills. Also, the jumper will grow and pop a bubble every moment he spends inside. You get one bounce on the spikies if you fall, so use it well.

You can view the [demo here](http://js13kgames.com/entries/bubble-jumper).
